# Pacman-Search-Agent
Hi everyone. I've just finished my project for the university and I felt like I should put the project on this platform.
In this repository we aim to create a pacman agent to search for it's food with different alogrithms
In order to see if the scripts are working please use the command.txt file and copy one of the commands and then paste it to your terminal that exists in your IDE.
Enjoy!!!!
